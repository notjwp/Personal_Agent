"""Practice-project runner and scorer.

Two modes, one file (the build spec permits a single harness file):

  OUTER (host)       python eval/harness.py [--split dev] [--case ID] [--runs N]
                     selects cases, spawns ONE container per case-run, aggregates,
                     prints `pass N/M`.

  INNER (container)  python eval/harness.py --run-case ID --run-index K --out DIR
                     runs setup, invokes the agent, runs check, writes one trace.

Why a container per case-run: `missing-dep` installs a package into site-packages.
Sharing one container across runs would leave it installed, so repeats of that case
would pass without the agent doing anything - quietly faking the baseline.
