"""On-demand knowledge documents, in the agentskills.io layout (Phase N).

A skill is a directory holding `SKILL.md` - YAML frontmatter with `name` and
`description`, then a markdown body - plus any reference files or scripts it
bundles.

**Progressive disclosure is the entire point, and on this provider it is not a
nicety.** Phase L measured `cache_read_tokens: 0` on every row of a scored run,
so everything in the prompt is re-sent and re-paid on every turn; four tool
schemas were already ~23% of a median run. A knowledge library injected wholesale
would be ruinous. So:

    Level 1  always loaded   name + description, ~40 tokens per skill
    Level 2  on demand       the SKILL.md body
    Level 3  on demand       bundled reference files

The cost of a skill is paid only when the agent decides it applies.

**This module READS. It never executes.** A bundled script is run by the agent
calling `run_shell` on it, which goes through classify() and the DANGER regex like
anything else. That grants nothing `run_shell` does not already grant inside a
container whose boundary Phase K made kernel-enforced - what Level 3 changes is
PROVENANCE, code arriving in a document rather than from the model. In Phase N
every skill is written by a human; **when Phase O lets the agent author them, this
becomes a live question and must be re-opened.**

Retrieval is keyword-shaped and stays that way: §11 forbids vectors until keyword
recall is measured and found wanting, and Phase M measured keyword recall working.
