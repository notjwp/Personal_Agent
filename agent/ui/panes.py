"""One interface, eight implementations. What earns this module under CE-01.

A pane is a DISPOSABLE VIEW over state the workspace owns. Textual has no
reparent API, so any layout change rebuilds the container tree; that is only
correct if rebuilding is cheap, which means no pane may be the only place its
data lives. Every one of these repopulates itself from the screen in
`refresh_from`, and a rebuild during streaming is a defect (section 12.5).

Chrome comes from the `Pane` base and from noesis.tcss. The count sits in the
BOTTOM border rather than beside the title: textual gives one title per edge,
so `border_title` and `border_subtitle` are the two slots there are.
