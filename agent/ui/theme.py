"""Three palettes, and the switches that pick between them.

Every colour in the interface is one lookup here, and that is load bearing
twice. Three themes only work if nothing else holds a hex. And transparency
(section 10) only works if every foreground is explicitly SET: under
`ansi_color=True` an UNSET colour silently degrades to the terminal's sixteen
ANSI colours, while an explicit one survives as truecolor.

MEASURED against textual 8.0.1, and it decides the shape of this file:

  - The stylesheet is parsed before the theme is applied, so `$muted` and the
    other custom variables are undefined unless the theme is registered AND
    selected in `App.__init__`. `NoesisApp` does exactly that.
  - Assigning an unregistered name raises `InvalidThemeError`, so section
    4.4's "falls back without raising" is `resolve()`'s job, not Textual's.
  - `catppuccin-mocha` and `tokyo-night` are also BUILT-IN Textual theme
    names, and registering these shadows them. Intentional: the palettes below
    are the spec's, and the tokyo one is deliberately narrowed to three hues.
