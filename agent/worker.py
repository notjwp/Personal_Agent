"""The task queue and the worker that drains it (FR-601, FR-602, FR-604).

§12 deferred this file with the trigger "when FR-6xx enters scope". It fires
here: the three requirements are `[M]`, and §9 puts scope in play once the `[M]`
set passes evaluation, which it has.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. Hermes's equivalent is `cron/scheduler.py`, 7,644 lines welded
to a 13,732-line state module, and none of it can be lifted. What ports is
`cron/executions.py` - 284 lines of stdlib and SQLite - and specifically two
ideas from it, both of which are about not lying about state:

  IDEMPOTENT TRANSITIONS.  `UPDATE ... WHERE id=? AND status='queued'` followed
  by `if cur.rowcount != 1: return None`. A transition applies exactly once and a
  second attempt DECLINES rather than corrupting the row. That is NFR-302 - no
  duplicated side effects on resume - expressed in SQL, and it is the same
  discipline CE-07 enforces in the graph.

  LIVENESS BY pid AND START TIME.  A crashed worker leaves a row saying
  `running` forever. A pid alone cannot detect that, because pids are recycled
  and the next process to claim one would look like the original. The pair
  cannot be.

WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIVERGES FROM HERMES. It marks an abandoned execution
`unknown` and refuses to retry, on the ground that "whether side effects ran is
unknown". That is correct for Hermes and wrong here: this project checkpoints
after every node transition and CE-07 keeps `gate` and `execute` separate
precisely so a resumed run cannot re-fire a tool. An abandoned task therefore
goes back to `queued`, and the worker that picks it up RESUMES from the
checkpoint rather than restarting - which is FR-603, and the reason it is safe.

CE-05: nothing here runs at import; the database is created on first use.
NFR-602: every function below is testable with no API key and no network.
