"""Secret-shaped values in tool output (NFR-203).

`context.redact()` replaces values it finds in `os.environ`. That covers the
container's own credentials and nothing else - measured, a workspace `.env`, an
`AWS_KEY = "AKIA..."` in source, and a `postgres://user:pw@host` DSN all reached
the model verbatim.

THE PATTERN LIST IS THE VALUE, and it is Hermes's, from `agent/redact.py`
(`_PREFIX_PATTERNS`, `_PRIVATE_KEY_RE`, `_JWT_RE`). Forty issuers with a literal
prefix each, accumulated from real incidents; a hand-written list would be shorter
and wrong. MIT, see NOTICE.

WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY LEFT BEHIND, and this is the whole design decision. Their
module is 1,427 lines and also matches `NAME=value` where NAME merely *contains*
key/token/secret/password. That is right for terminal output and chat, which is
where Hermes applies it - and catastrophic on source code, which is what this
agent reads all day. Measured against our own tree, their full redactor altered
29 lines of 14,243, including:

    spent_tokens: int              ->  spent_tokens: ***
    budget_tokens: int | None      ->  budget_tokens: *** | None
    max_tokens=settings.MAX_TOKENS ->  max_tokens=settin...ENS

Type annotations and identifiers destroyed. Any tokenizer, auth module or config
file would become unreadable to the agent trying to fix it.

Only shapes that cannot collide with an identifier are kept: a literal issuer
prefix, a PEM block, a JWT, or a DSN password. All four are unambiguous.
