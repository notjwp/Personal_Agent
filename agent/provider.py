"""The model adapter (NFR-702).

This module exists because there are now TWO implementations behind one seam —
Anthropic's native API and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (NVIDIA NIM by default).
CE-01 requires two callers or two implementations before a module is justified;
until the second provider arrived, this code correctly lived inside the act node.

The rest of the system speaks ONE message shape: Anthropic-style content blocks.
That shape is fixed by the state contract, and every node, test and trace already
uses it. The OpenAI-compatible provider translates at its own boundary and nowhere
else, so no other file learns that a second provider exists.
