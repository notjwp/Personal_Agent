"""Schema migrations for the SQLite stores (Phase A).

Every store was created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which is correct for a
fresh database and silently WRONG for an existing one: it skips the statement
entirely, so a column added later does not appear and the failure surfaces as a
confusing SQL error at some random call site rather than at startup.

That is not theoretical here. `episodes_fts` gained `tokenize='porter'` on
2026-08-31; every memory database written before that keeps the default tokenizer
while the code assumes porter. Two agents on the same commit, different retrieval,
no error anywhere.

The shape is Vellum's, not its scale - they carry 321 migrations because they have
a product's history behind them, and this starts at 1.

THE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE, and it is the one their own numbering enforces:
a migration is identified by its POSITION and never re-ordered, never edited once
released, and never conditional on what a table currently looks like. Inspecting
the current shape is how two databases at the same version come to differ.

CE-05: nothing runs at import. NFR-602: no API key, no network.
