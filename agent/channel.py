"""Email intake and delivery: the agent becomes something you can write to.

The whole file rests on one decision - A MESSAGE MAPS TO A TASK, and a task id
IS a thread id. Nothing here invents a second identity space, a second queue or a
second liveness check; worker.py already has all three, and Vellum's runtime is
171k lines largely because delivery, sessions and identity grew up separately
there.

Three designs are taken from Hermes's email adapter and none is lifted - theirs
is 1,510 lines across six mail providers:

- DEFAULT DENY on who may write (gateway/authz_mixin.py). The moment a message
  can arrive from outside the terminal, "who is asking" is a security question,
  and policy.classify() assumes one trusted local user. An address is trivially
  forged, so this is a filter on a mailbox you control, NOT authentication.
- A FIRST RUN MARKS THE EXISTING INBOX SEEN rather than answering it. Theirs
  logs "%d existing messages skipped" for the same reason: without it, starting
  the listener replies to every message you have ever received.
- AN OUTBOUND REPLY IS A ROW WITH A STATE (gateway/delivery_ledger.py). A send
  that fails must not lose the answer and a poison row must not spin.
