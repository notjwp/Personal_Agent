"""AgentState, the v1 nodes, and the graph wiring.

Only `act` touches the model. `gate`, `execute`, `reflect` and `finish` are ordinary
code, unit-testable without an API key (NFR-602). That ratio is the most important
design property here, so resist moving logic into the prompt.

Corrections mandated by the build spec, all applied below:
  (a) the entry edge is START -> act; there is no plan node at v1
  (b) `done` is gated on whether a tool call was EVER made, not on a plan cursor
  (c) `failures` is a plain int counting CONSECUTIVE failed turns, reset on success
  (d) the risk map in policy.py is the single path to a verdict
  (e) tracing is present now, not deferred
