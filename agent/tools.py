"""The built-in tools, and the risk each one carries.

Ten of them, and their schemas are DERIVED from the signature and docstring by
`@tool` in agent/registry.py (FR-207). They were hand-written until tool eight,
when §13's arithmetic - ~25 lines plus ~5 per tool for the machinery against ~8
per tool written out - stopped favouring the dicts.

Tools RAISE on failure and never return an error string — the execute node owns
the exception-to-observation conversion (FR-208).

Tools do NOT re-check paths. The gate checks declared path arguments, and the
container's single writable mount bounds arbitrary shell. Two mechanisms guarding
one risk is what §13 cut the INSTALL set for.

Adding a tool touches this file only (NFR-601).
