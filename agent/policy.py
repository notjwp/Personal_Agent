"""classify() — the gate's entire decision logic.

NO SIDE EFFECTS (FR-305). The gate node suspends on `interrupt()` and re-executes
from its first line when a run resumes, so anything that logged, counted, or wrote
here would happen twice.

Note `from agent import config` rather than `from agent.config import WORKSPACE`:
the latter binds the value at import time, so a test redirecting the workspace root
would leave this module still pointing at the real one.
