"""MCP client — a third party's tools, inside the sandbox, behind the same gate.

§11's non-goal forbids "dynamic tool loading". Phase L amends it for servers that
meet three conditions, and this module is where two of them are enforced:

  1. Baked into the image at BUILD time. `/etc/pip.conf` sets no-index, so nothing
     can be installed at run time - a server cannot be introduced mid-run.
  2. Run INSIDE the sandbox. The server is a subprocess of the agent, so it
     inherits the container's mounts and network namespace and Phase K's boundary
     already contains it, with no new mechanism. A server on the host would have
     host access and would make the container decorative.
  3. Every tool risk-classified BEFORE its schema is shown to the model, by
     policy.register(), which refuses to default an unclassified tool to `read`.

Tools RAISE on failure and never return an error string - the execute node owns
the exception-to-observation conversion (FR-208), exactly as tools.py does.

CE-05: nothing here runs at import. `activate()` is called once per run.
