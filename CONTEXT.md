0. HOW TO USE THIS FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paste this whole file as project context into a coding agent (Claude Code,
Antigravity, Cursor) or attach it as CONTEXT.md at the repo root.

Read sections 1-4 to understand the system. Read section 9 to know what to build
FIRST. Sections 5-7 are the full requirement set for the finished system and are
NOT a build order — do not implement them top to bottom.

Rules for the implementing agent:
  - Section 9 is the only build order. Anything marked [S] or [C] in sections
    6-7 is out of scope until the [M] set passes evaluation.
  - Section 12 lists every file that may exist in v1. Do not create others.
  - Section 13 is binding. Violating a CE rule is a defect, not a style choice.
  - Every deterministic node must be unit-testable without an API key.
  - When a requirement and existing code disagree, the requirement wins; say so
    rather than silently reinterpreting it.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A single-user autonomous agent that runs on the owner's personal machine. It
accepts a goal in natural language, decomposes it into steps, and works the
steps by calling tools — reading and writing files, running shell commands and
Python, operating git, searching and reading the web — looping until the goal is
met, it gets stuck, or it exhausts its budget.

Three properties separate this from a chat wrapper with function calling:

  (a) EVERY tool call passes a deterministic policy gate before any side effect.
      Nothing destructive runs unapproved. In unattended mode, anything that
      would need approval is refused and queued for later review rather than
      guessed at.

  (b) NO tool output reaches the model unfiltered. Results are truncated, the
      full output is spilled to an artifact file, and the model gets a summary
      plus a path it can re-read selectively. This is what allows tasks to run
      past ~15 turns without the context window collapsing.

  (c) State is checkpointed after every node transition. A killed process loses
      at most one node of work, and a task resumes rather than restarts.

Target environment: Fedora Linux natively, Windows via WSL2. Execution is
confined to a container with a single bind-mounted workspace directory.

Success is measured, not asserted: a fixture suite of repo-repair tasks is run
headlessly and scored by exit code. The pass rate is the project's headline
number.

Layers the naive design omits, and why each exists:

  POLICY GATE      The model will eventually emit `rm -rf`, `git push --force`,
                   or a pip install into system Python. Classify before running.

  CONTEXT MANAGER  A single `ls -R` over node_modules or a 3000-line file read
                   ends the task. Bound every result on the way in.

  SANDBOX          "Terminal" is not a tool, it is an execution environment with
                   an enforced workspace root.

  SCHEDULER SPLIT  The chat process must not be the execution process, or you
                   cannot detach from a task that has been running 40 minutes.

Node classification:

  LLM CALLS (3)          plan, act, compact-summarisation, and the reflect
                         node's optional tie-break (default: none)
  DETERMINISTIC (5)      gate, execute, observe, reflect, finish
  HUMAN                  await approval, reachable only from gate

Only three nodes touch the model. Everything else is ordinary code you can unit
test. This ratio is the single most important design property of the system.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. WORKFLOW / EXECUTION SEMANTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 TURN LIFECYCLE

  1. A goal arrives from chat or from the task queue.
  2. PLAN produces an ordered step list. Cursor set to 0.
  3. ACT calls the model with the full message history, the tool schemas, and
     the current step injected into the system prompt (NOT appended as a user
     message — that pollutes history and creates gaps).
  4. Router inspects the last assistant message:
       - contains tool_use blocks  -> GATE
       - text only                 -> REFLECT (step complete, not termination)
  5. GATE classifies each tool call independently. Mixed verdicts in one turn
     are legal: some calls approved, others denied.
  6. EXECUTE runs approved calls. Tool exceptions are caught and converted to
     observations; they never propagate out of the node.
  7. OBSERVE shrinks each result, spills overflow to .agent/artifacts/<id>.txt,
     and appends tool_result blocks as a single user message.
  8. REFLECT emits exactly one verdict. Checks run in this fixed order:
       a. spent_tokens > 60% of budget          -> compact
       b. turns >= max_turns                    -> stuck
       c. last 3 tool signatures identical      -> stuck
       d. 3 consecutive failures                -> replan
       e. last message is assistant text        -> done if final step,
                                                   else continue + advance cursor
       f. otherwise                             -> continue
  9. Terminal verdicts route to FINISH, which writes durable memory and ends.

4.2 APPROVAL SEMANTICS

  Interactive mode: a `confirm` verdict suspends the graph. The user sees the
  exact command or argument set, unabbreviated, and approves or rejects.

  Autonomous mode: `confirm` becomes `deny`. The request is recorded in a review
  queue. The agent receives a denial observation and must find another route.
  The same policy code serves both modes — do not fork it.

  CRITICAL RE-ENTRANCY RULE: the gate node re-executes from its first line when
  execution resumes after approval. It must therefore be free of side effects.
  No logging, no counter increments, no database writes inside gate. This rule
  applies to any node placed upstream of a suspension point.

4.3 CONTEXT DISCIPLINE

  - Each tool declares its own output cap. Shell gets more than file writes.
  - Over-cap results are written to disk in full; the model receives head lines,
    an elision marker, tail lines, and the artifact path.
  - The spill message must tell the model how to inspect further (read_file with
    offset/limit, or grep against the path). A path with no instruction is
    ignored by the model in practice.
  - Compaction preserves the first two messages and the last six verbatim,
    summarising only the middle. The summary retains: decisions made, files
    touched, commands that worked, errors hit, artifact paths. Nothing else.

4.4 PERSISTENCE

  - Checkpoint after every node transition, keyed by thread_id.
  - A task's identity is its thread_id. Resume is re-invocation with the same id.
  - Chat threads and background tasks share the checkpoint store. A chat session
    attaching to a running task is just a reader on the same thread.

4.5 EVALUATION LOOP

  1. Reset workspace to the fixture's known state.
  2. Invoke the graph in autonomous mode (so nothing blocks on approval).
  3. Run the fixture's check command. Exit code 0 is a pass.
  4. Record: pass, turns, tool calls, tokens, seconds, terminal verdict.
  5. Append to a timestamped run file. Report the delta against the prior run.

               path, plus instructions for inspecting it.
  FR-403  [M]  Compact conversation history when context use exceeds a
               configured fraction of budget.
  FR-404  [M]  Preserve the opening messages and the most recent turns verbatim

  FR-505  [S]  Honour robots.txt and apply per-domain rate limiting.

6.6 AUTONOMY (FR-6xx)

  FR-601  [M]  Accept a task into a queue and return a task identifier

Verification for the FR-1xx and FR-2xx families is the eval harness. A
requirement is satisfied when the cases exercising it pass, not when the code
exists.

8.2 CONFLICTS — stated, not papered over

  UR-13 vs UR-05
    Unattended operation and per-action visibility are mutually exclusive.
    Resolution: FR-304. Autonomous mode denies rather than pauses and defers to
    a review queue. Less gets done unattended; nothing catastrophic happens.

  NFR-104 vs FR-208
    Truncating tool output loses information needed to diagnose an error.
    Resolution: FR-402 spill-and-path. Costs one extra tool call, buys a
    bounded context.

  FR-503/504 vs NFR-402                    UPDATED 2026-08-31
    Browser automation is the largest token consumer in the system and will
    breach the cost target alone. This is why it sits at [S] behind FR-501/502:
    search plus text extraction covers most real requests at a fraction of the
    spend.
    That last clause was an argument when written and is now a MEASUREMENT: the
    search split scores 9/9 with web_search and 0/9 with it removed, so the
    cheaper path demonstrably covers the cases that exist.
    Costed 2026-08-31: Chromium into a 593 MB image, which pip.conf's no-index
    forces to build time; and 4-6 tool schemas at ~580 chars each against 5,949
    chars of remaining MAX_SCHEMA_CHARS, charged on EVERY request of every run
    whether a browser is used or not.
    Resolution: FR-503 and FR-504 stay UNMET, deliberately. They are built only
    when a case exists that web_search plus fetch cannot solve, and then BOTH
    together - FR-503 alone is the raw-DOM version this entry calls unaffordable
    - with its own split and a control run.

  FR-204 vs NFR-201, NFR-205 and reproducibility     ADDED 2026-08-31
    "Install packages into the sandbox on request" cannot hold as written.
    Three properties of the measured environment forbid it, and each exists
    for a reason that outranks a [S]:
      - /etc/pip.conf sets no-index. The Containerfile states the purpose
        twice: every dependency must be baked at build time "or it does not
        exist", which is also the security property - a server or library
        cannot be introduced mid-run.
      - The root filesystem is --read-only (NFR-201), so site-packages is
        immutable while a run is in flight.
      - Egress is allowlisted to the model host (NFR-205). PyPI is not
        reachable, and a case declaring it would be declaring a different
        measurement.
    Implementing FR-204 at RUN time trades all three for a should-have.
    Resolution: FR-204 is satisfied at BUILD time. A dependency is added to
    the Containerfile and the image rebuilt, where the manifest records it and
    every scored row states the image it ran on. It is NOT available at run
    time, and that is a property being protected rather than a gap.

  FR-408 vs its own gate                   ADDED 2026-08-31
    FR-408 gates semantic retrieval on a measured shortfall in keyword recall.
    Measured 2026-08-31, offline, against the six recall/profile cases - the
    only ground truth in the project where a stored episode and the query that
    should retrieve it are worded differently.
      In the system AS IT RUNS there is no shortfall to gate on. Every eval
      home holds at most three episodes, the recall+profile split scores 6/6,
      and two of those six carry no AGENT.md at all, so they passed through
      episode search rather than the profile.
      A shortfall appears only in a corpus that has never existed: 36 distinct
      goals pooled from every home. There recall@3 is 2/6 - and the cause is
      the QUERY, not the index. _terms() ORs every word over two characters, so
      write, file, workspace and called outvote Quartzite. Keeping only the
      five rarest terms by corpus document frequency scores 5/6 at rank 1, on a
      plateau spanning k in {3,5,6,8} at every threshold. Porter stemming was
      tried and is flat-to-worse; it is not the fix.
    The one residual miss is a true vocabulary gap: two seconds against
    duration in centiseconds shares exactly one term, and that term is write.
    Resolution: FR-408 stays UNBUILT and is closed as NOT JUSTIFIED. Its gate
    asked for a shortfall in keyword retrieval; what was found is a shortfall
    in query construction, worth 3 of the 4 failures and free to fix. One case
    in six is not an embedding model, an image dependency and a share of
    MAX_SCHEMA_CHARS. It reopens if a real corpus reproduces the shortfall
    after the query fix, which is the condition to re-measure - not to assume.

  NFR-802 vs FR-302 and NFR-201            ADDED 2026-08-23
    "All agent artifacts under ONE inspectable directory" cannot be satisfied
    without breaking one of the other two, and the collision is structural
    rather than a tidying job left undone.
      - FR-302 confines read_file to the workspace. A spilled artifact written
        outside it is unreadable BY THE MODEL, and shrink()'s entire design is
        that the model can re-read a spill it was given a path to.
      - NFR-201 (as amended) puts durable state outside the workspace precisely
        because reset.sh wipes the workspace between runs.
    Resolution: TWO declared inspectable roots, not one.
      .agent/artifacts/  inside the workspace, where the model can read them
      /state             outside it, where reset.sh cannot reach
    Both are declared, both are inspectable, and nothing is hidden - which is
    what NFR-802 was protecting. Moving artifacts to /state would satisfy the
    wording and break the mechanism, so the wording is what gives way.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. BUILD SEQUENCE — THE ONLY ORDER THAT MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not implement sections 5-7 in order. Build in the order below.

TARGET LOOP FOR V1: given a repository with a failing test, make it pass.
Bounded, scored by exit code, needs no human judgement.

Each step has an EXIT CRITERION; do not begin the next until it holds. If a step
overruns its estimate by more than double, stop and reduce scope.

  STEP 1  FIXTURES AND A NULL AGENT.  Prove the rig works before there is
          anything to measure. `app.invoke()` returns its input unchanged, so a
          0/5 is unambiguously the agent rather than a broken reset.sh.
          EXIT: the harness prints `pass 0/5`; every setup exits 0 and every
          check exits non-zero; deleting a fixture's bug by hand flips that case
          to pass, which is what proves the check discriminates.
          TRAPS, still live whenever a case is added: a check that fails for the
          WRONG reason (a collection error rather than an assertion) will mask a
          working agent later, so read the output rather than the exit code; and
          reset.sh must remove untracked files, not just `git checkout`, because
          the agent creates them.

  STEP 2  THE THINNEST LOOP THAT RUNS.  act -> gate -> execute -> reflect,
          three tools, real tool-calling, tracing from the start.
          EXIT: at least one dev case passes end to end, and the trace shows the
          tool calls that did it.

  Required code changes from the skeleton
    (a) Rewire the entry edge: START -> "act", not START -> "plan".

    (b) TERMINATION GUARD. With no plan node, `plan` is [] and `cursor` is 0,
        so the reflect check `cursor + 1 >= len(plan)` evaluates `1 >= 0` and
        returns `done` on the FIRST text-only reply — including "Let me look at
        the test file first." Replace with:

            if s["messages"][-1]["role"] == "assistant":
                made_a_call = any(b["type"] == "tool_use"
                                  for m in s["messages"] if m["role"] == "assistant"
                                  for b in m["content"])
                return {"verdict": "done" if made_a_call else "continue"}

        Restore the cursor-based check only when the plan node is added.

    (c) FAILURE COUNTER. `failures` as Annotated[list, add] never resets —
        `plan` returning {"failures": []} appends an empty list, it does not
        clear. So `len(failures) >= 3` latches true for the rest of the run.
        Change to a plain int with overwrite semantics counting CONSECUTIVE
        failures: observe sets it to 0 when every result succeeded, otherwise
        increments it.

    (d) RISK MAP. `run_shell` is declared risk="destructive" but classify()
        special-cases the name and returns before consulting RISK, so the
        declaration is dead. Any future tool marked destructive would be
        silently auto-denied in autonomous mode and never run during eval.
        Either relabel run_shell as "write", or make RISK the single path.

    (e) TRACING (FR-805 scoped in early, not deferred). The harness writes
        eval/runs/<timestamp>/<case-id>.json containing the full final message
        list plus per-call metadata: tool name, verdict, duration, input bytes,
        output bytes, spilled path. Step 4 is unactionable without this.


  STEP 3  BASELINE.  A number with an error bar, not a number: 3 runs per case.
          EXIT: the baseline is recorded in eval/CHANGELOG.md with its
          conditions - model, split, date, blocked runs excluded.
          TRAP: a case that passes 1 of 3 seeds is NOT a passing case. Report
          pass counts, never a single run.

  STEP 4 — ONE FIX PER CYCLE                                      repeat
................................................................................

  Goal: change one thing, measure, keep or revert.

  Read the traces. Classify every failure into exactly one bucket, then fix
  only the largest bucket.

    SYMPTOM IN TRACE                          BUCKET          FIX
    ----------------------------------------  --------------  ---------------
    One tool_result dominates the transcript  context flood   FR-401/402
    Same argument hash 3+ times in a row       thrashing       FR-106
    Verdict `stuck` at max_turns, no repeats   no strategy     plan node
    Edits a file it never read                 blind editing   prompt (SOUL.md)
    Runs pytest once, never re-runs            no verify loop  prompt (SOUL.md)
    Verdict `done` with the test still failing termination bug  reflect logic
    Tool exception repeated verbatim           bad error text  tool return value

  Rules for this step
    - One change per cycle. Two changes and you cannot attribute the delta.
    - Prompt changes count as changes and must be measured like code changes.
    - Revert anything that does not move the number. Keeping a neutral change
      because it "seems right" is how the loop rots.
    - Log each cycle in eval/CHANGELOG.md: hypothesis, change, before, after,
      kept or reverted.

  EXIT CRITERION per cycle
    Baseline re-run at 3 seeds, delta recorded, decision logged.

.............................................................................

  STEP 5  HOLD-OUT AND STABILISE.  Confirm you improved the agent rather than
          the dev cases. Write 10 further cases and DO NOT look at their traces
          during step 4; run them only at milestones.
          EXIT: dev stable at >= 4/5 across 3 seeds, and the held-out set scored
          once with the result recorded WHATEVER it is. A held-out score well
          below dev is information, not failure - it says which fixes were
          general.

  AFTER V1 — LAYER ORDER
................................................................................

  Add one layer at a time. Each must be justified by a measured eval delta or
  by a requirement it unblocks; do not fix the order in advance.

  Likely order on repo-repair tasks, with the reasoning:
    1. compaction     a 12-turn bug fix does not need decomposition, it needs
                      to not drown in file contents
    2. plan node      earns its place only once tasks span multiple files
    3. resume/SIGKILL exercises the checkpointer already present from step 2
    4. memory         needs episodic recall to have something worth recalling
    5. web            largest token cost, smallest v1 benefit
    6. scheduler      pure infrastructure, no effect on the pass rate

  The stated order is a prediction, not a plan. If compaction moves nothing and
  the plan node moves 20 points, the prediction was wrong and the numbers win.

10. DEFINITION OF DONE (V1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] 5 dev cases + 10 held-out cases in eval/tasks.jsonl
  [ ] Dev set >= 4/5 across 3 seeds; held-out set scored at least once and the
      number recorded, whatever it is
  [ ] Zero writes outside the two declared roots across the full suite
      (NFR-201, as amended)
  [ ] Median case completes within the turn and token caps (NFR-402)
  [ ] Every deterministic node has unit tests that run without an API key
  [ ] A SIGKILL mid-task, followed by resume, completes without duplicated
      side effects (NFR-302)
  [x] Adding a new tool touches exactly one file (NFR-601)
      TRUE SINCE 2026-08-23, and it was NOT before: TOOLS carried the function
      and the schema while RISK was a literal in policy.py, so every built-in
      since v1 touched two files. A tool now declares `risk` beside its schema
      and policy.risk_of() reads it, falling back to tools.TOOLS so a tool added
      after import is classifiable without a sync() call.
  [ ] eval/runs/ contains at least three dated runs, each with per-case trace
      files, showing the improvement trajectory
  [ ] eval/CHANGELOG.md records every tuning cycle: hypothesis, change,
      before, after, kept or reverted


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. NON-GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Multi-user support, auth, tenancy.
  - Multi-agent orchestration, sub-agent spawning, agent-to-agent protocols.
  - A web UI. CLI/TUI only.
  - Voice (FR-704 is explicitly [W]).
  - A general-purpose plugin marketplace or dynamic tool loading.
    AMENDED 2026-08-21: permitted ONLY through MCP servers meeting all three of
    (a) baked into the image at BUILD time, since pip.conf sets no-index and a
    server therefore cannot be introduced mid-run; (b) run INSIDE the sandbox as
    a subprocess, so a server cannot have host access the container does not;
    (c) every tool risk-classified BEFORE its schema reaches the model -
    policy.register() records an unclassified tool as `destructive`, never
    `read`. Bounded by config.MAX_SCHEMA_CHARS. A marketplace, and run-time
    installation of a server, remain non-goals.
  - Vector search before keyword recall has been measured and found wanting.
  - Fine-tuning or local model hosting for the orchestrator.
  - Windows-native support outside WSL2.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. REPOSITORY LAYOUT

will be filled with speculative code and will rot.

WHY EACH DEVIATION WAS ALLOWED IS IN eval/CHANGELOG.md, one section per phase.

re-argue a decision that has already been measured.

                       indistinguishable from a bad day), test_worker (a queue
                       that hands one task to two workers, or leaves a crashed
                       worker's row saying `running` forever, raises nothing -
                       it just does the work twice, or never). Do not add an

      worker.py        the task queue and the worker that drains it (FR-601,
                       FR-602, FR-604). §12's trigger "when FR-6xx enters scope"
                       fired. Tasks in SQLite at /state/tasks.db, status
                       constrained by a CHECK rather than by convention, and
                       every transition idempotent so a second attempt declines
                       instead of corrupting a row. FR-603 is free: the task id
                       IS the thread id, so a requeued task resumes from its
                       checkpoint rather than restarting.

DEFERRED FILES - create each only when its trigger fires

  agent/web.py         when FR-501/502 enter scope. THE TRIGGER FIRED 2026-08-29
                       and the file was still NOT created, which is stated here
                       rather than left to be noticed. FR-501 is one decorated
                       function; a module for it costs a Definition-of-Done item,
                       because NFR-601 asks that adding a tool require editing
                       exactly one file and a new module means editing
                       registry.toolset() as well. This section bounds what MAY
                       exist, not what must, so declining to create a permitted
                       file is compliant. If FR-503/504 are ever built here rather
                       than through MCP, the trigger stands and the arithmetic
                       flips - browser automation is not one function.

RESOLVED DEFECTS FROM THE PREVIOUS LAYOUT

  - state.py folded into graph.py: one caller, one implementation.
  - The workspace root was defined in two modules. FR-302 and NFR-201 both
    depend on those agreeing, so it lives in config.py alone.
  - AGENT.md moved out of prompts/: it is runtime-mutable state the agent
    writes, not a version-controlled prompt.
  - tests/ added (NFR-602). cli.py added (FR-701 is [M] and nothing was
    invocable outside the harness).

Task fixture schema (one JSON object per line in eval/tasks.jsonl):

  {"id": "fix-import", "goal": "Tests in tests/ fail on an import error. Fix it.",
   "setup": "scripts/reset.sh fix-import", "check": "cd /workspace && pytest -q",
   "split": "dev", "max_turns": 12, "budget": 200000}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. CODE ECONOMY RULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binding on the implementing agent. Violations are defects, not style notes.

  CE-01  A separate module requires two callers OR two implementations.
         One of each is not enough.

  CE-02  A framework earns its place at break-even, not before. Count the
         lines it costs against the lines it saves at the CURRENT scale, not
         the anticipated one.

  CE-03  Every state field must be read somewhere. A field only ever written
         is dead weight that survives because it looks purposeful.

  CE-04  Two nodes that never branch apart are one node. See CE-07 for the
         one exception.

  CE-05  No module-level I/O and no module-level client construction. Reading
         a prompt file at import time breaks every test that imports the
         module.

  CE-06  Prefer default overwrite semantics for state. Custom reducers are
         justified only when two nodes write the same field in one superstep.

  CE-07  EXCEPTION TO CE-04: gate and execute must never merge. gate suspends
         on interrupt() and re-executes from its first line on resume. Merged,
         every already-executed tool fires a second time. This separation is
         load-bearing, not stylistic.

The v1 skeleton lost roughly 80 of 205 lines to these rules: a custom reducer
and its sentinel (CE-06), the @tool decorator at three tools (CE-02, since
earned at eight), observe as a separate node (CE-04), and four state fields
nothing read (CE-03). The full accounting is in eval/CHANGELOG.md.

State is a plain TypedDict - no reducers, no Annotated, no operator import.
Nodes return the FULL messages list, so compaction is an ordinary return rather
than a custom merge. shrink() returns a plain string, not a tuple: the spill
path belongs inside the returned text, where the model can act on it.

RECONCILIATION WITH SECTIONS 3 AND 4

  The control-flow diagram in section 3 and the turn lifecycle in section 4.1
  show EXECUTE and OBSERVE as distinct stages. They remain distinct STAGES;
  CE-04 makes them a single NODE in the implementation, because no edge ever
  separates them. Read section 3 as the logical flow and section 13 as the
  code shape. Where the two are compared, section 13 governs.

  Consequently section 3's deterministic node count is four in v1, not five:
  gate, execute (absorbing observe), reflect, finish.
