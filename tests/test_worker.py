"""The task queue and the worker (FR-601, FR-602, FR-603, FR-604).

The SEVENTH stated deviation from §12's three-file tests/ allowlist, to the same
standard as the others - the component's failure is SILENT. A queue that hands
one task to two workers, or that leaves a crashed worker's row saying `running`
forever, does not raise anything. It just quietly does the work twice, or never.
Neither shows up in another suite, and neither shows up in a pass rate.
