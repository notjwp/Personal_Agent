"""Episodic memory and the durable profile.

A seventh test file, and the fifth stated deviation from the spec's three-file
`tests/` allowlist. The justification is narrow and specific: **memory is the one
component whose failure is silent by construction.** A tool that breaks throws; a
memory that never retrieves just makes the agent look forgetful, which is
indistinguishable from a model having a bad day. The recall benchmark catches that
end-to-end at the cost of model quota; these catch it for free.

No API key, no network (NFR-602). Every test points the stores at a temp directory,
because `config.MEMORY_DB` otherwise resolves to the real agent home.
