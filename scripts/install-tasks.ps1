# Register the agent's two loops with Windows Task Scheduler.
#
# Task Scheduler is the supervisor, not a daemon we wrote: it already restarts a
# crashed process and starts one at logon, which is the whole job. A `--daemon`
# subcommand would be ~60 lines re-implementing that badly.
#
# The one thing it must NOT do is restart a rejected password into a loop -
# `--channel` exits 2 on ChannelRefused, and RestartCount stops after 3 tries so
# a permanent failure stops rather than spinning.
